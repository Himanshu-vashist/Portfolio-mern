              <p>
                I'm <strong>Himanshu Kumar</strong>, a versatile <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> specializing in both web and mobile application development. As an Information Technology student at Heritage Institute of Technology, Kolkata, I combine technical expertise with creative problem-solving to build innovative digital solutions.

                üíª My technical toolkit spans the <strong>MERN stack</strong> (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for web development and <strong>React Native with Expo</strong> for cross-platform mobile applications. I've developed a diverse portfolio of projects including educational gaming platforms, agricultural support applications, and e-commerce solutions.

                üöÄ At <strong>Jabsz Gaming Studios LLP</strong>, I've honed my skills in mobile development, working with technologies like Firebase, Google Authentication, and AdMob integration. My experience includes building responsive interfaces, implementing secure authentication systems, and creating monetization strategies.

                üå± I'm passionate about creating technology that makes a real difference in people's lives. Whether it's helping farmers with digital tools or making education more engaging through interactive games, I strive to develop applications that solve meaningful problems.

                üîç I approach each project with meticulous attention to detail, a commitment to clean code, and a focus on creating intuitive user experiences. I'm constantly expanding my skillset, currently exploring TypeScript, cloud services, and advanced state management techniques.

                ü§ù I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life. I'm always open to new challenges and opportunities to create impactful digital experiences.
